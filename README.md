## 2D "Pong" in Unity3D (C#) with Artificial Neural Networks AI

Implementation of Pong in Unity3D based off this tutorial: http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game

Added sound effects, nicer background, and fixed a bug where the ball would "stick" to the bottom/top walls.

The next step will be to implement a computer AI versus the player. This is going to be implemented using artificial neural networks.

**Note:** to ensure source control works fine between Unity3D and GitHub, do the following in Unity3D:

1. Switch to `Visible Meta Files` in `Editor → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode`

2. Switch to `Force Text` in `Editor → Project Settings → Editor → Asset Serialization Mode`

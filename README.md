## 2D "Pong" in Unity3D (C#) with Artificial Neural Networks AI

Implementation of Pong in Unity3D based off this tutorial: http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game

Added sound effects, nicer background, and fixed a bug where the ball would "stick" to the bottom/top walls.

The next step will be to implement a computer AI versus the player. This is going to be implemented using artificial neural networks.

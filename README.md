## 3D "Pong" in Unity3D (C#), soon with Artificial Neural Networks AI

Implementation of Pong in Unity3D.

To play: Press "A" and "D" for player 1 (left/right), and "Left arrow" and "Right arrow" for player 2.

The next step will be to implement a computer AI versus the player. This is going to be implemented using artificial neural networks.

**Note:** to ensure source control works fine between Unity3D and GitHub, do the following in Unity3D:

1. Switch to `Visible Meta Files` in `Editor → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode`

2. Switch to `Force Text` in `Editor → Project Settings → Editor → Asset Serialization Mode`
